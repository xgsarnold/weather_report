# Weather Report

This is a Ruby application for pulling data from multiple Weather Underground API endpoints and presenting a weather report to the user. It includes a test file to ensure the code runs without bugs. Users will be able to enter zip codes in order to receive information about current conditions, weather alerts, sunrise and sunset times, a ten day forecast, and hurricanes.

## Estimation:

5-6 hours total/1 hour a piece.

## Work Time:

It took 8 hours total to nearly finish the assignment. I found the final test and class most difficult given the amount of data to read through and its complicated format. In the end I couldn't figure it out quite well enough to finalize the class and pass the test.
